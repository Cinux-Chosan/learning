# Higher-Order Components

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

高阶组件是 React 中一项重用组件逻辑的高级技术。它本身并不是 React API 的一部分，而是伴随 React 组合的特性而出现的。

Concretely, **a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component**.

总结来说，**高阶组件是一个把一个组件转换成另一个组件的函数**。

```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```

Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.

常规组件把 props 转换成 UI，高阶组件把组件转换成另一个组件以满足某些需求。

HOCs are common in third-party React libraries, such as Redux’s [connect](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) and Relay’s [createFragmentContainer](http://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/fragment-container.html).

高阶组件在一些第三方库中很常见，如 Redux 中的 [connect](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) 和 Relay 的 [createFragmentContainer](http://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/fragment-container.html)。

In this document, we’ll discuss why higher-order components are useful, and how to write your own.

在当前文档中，我们将告诉你为什么高阶组件非常有用，以及如何编写自己的高阶组件。

## Use HOCs For Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Note**

We previously recommended mixins as a way to handle cross-cutting concerns. We’ve since realized that mixins create more trouble than they are worth. [Read more](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html) about why we’ve moved away from mixins and how you can transition your existing components.

最初我们推荐使用 mixin 来处理代码交叉（就是有一部分公共逻辑，但实际上又不满足继承，比如 A 和 B 都有某个常规需求，但 A 和 B 并没有任何关系）的问题。但后来我们意识到 mixin 带来的问题比它带来的好处还多。我们在[这里](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html) 告诉了你为什么要移除 mixin 以及你需要怎么把那些已经存在的组件从 mixin 中迁移出来。

Components are the primary unit of code reuse in React. However, you’ll find that some patterns aren’t a straightforward fit for traditional components.

组件是 React 中重用代码的主要单元。然而，你会发现传统组件对某些模式来说不太合适。

For example, say you have a `CommentList` component that subscribes to an external data source to render a list of comments:

例如，`CommentList` 组件订阅了外部数据源，并根据该数据源渲染了一个评论列表：

```js
class CommentList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      // "DataSource" is some global data source
      comments: DataSource.getComments()
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Subscribe to changes
    DataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Clean up listener
    DataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }

  handleChange() {
    // Update component state whenever the data source changes
    this.setState({
      comments: DataSource.getComments()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.comments.map((comment) => (
          <Comment comment={comment} key={comment.id} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Later, you write a component for subscribing to a single blog post, which follows a similar pattern:

然后你又写了一个组件来订阅该数据源的单个博文，遵循同样的模式：

```js
class BlogPost extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      blogPost: DataSource.getBlogPost(props.id)
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    DataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    DataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }

  handleChange() {
    this.setState({
      blogPost: DataSource.getBlogPost(this.props.id)
    });
  }

  render() {
    return <TextBlock text={this.state.blogPost} />;
  }
}
```

`CommentList` and `BlogPost` aren’t identical — they call different methods on `DataSource`, and they render different output. But much of their implementation is the same:

虽然 `CommentList` 和 `BlogPost` 并不相同 —— 因为它们调用的是 `DataSource` 上面不同的方法，并且渲染内容也不同，但它们的实现却大体差不多：

- On mount, add a change listener to `DataSource`.
>> 在挂载的时候监听 `DataSource` 改变。
- Inside the listener, call `setState` whenever the data source changes.
>> 在事件处理函数内部，调用了 `setState`，这样数据发生改变的时候就能及时做出响应。
- On unmount, remove the change listener.
>> 在组件被卸载的时候移除事件监听器。

You can imagine that in a large app, this same pattern of subscribing to `DataSource` and calling `setState` will occur over and over again. We want an abstraction that allows us to define this logic in a single place and share it across many components. This is where higher-order components excel.

你可以想象在一个大型应用中，调用 `DataSource` 和 `setState` 这样相同的操作将会被一遍又一遍的重复调用。此时我们希望把这一部分逻辑抽象出来，然后在某个地方定义一遍之后共享给其它组件。这正是高阶组件擅长做的事情。

We can write a function that creates components, like `CommentList` and `BlogPost`, that subscribe to `DataSource`. The function will accept as one of its arguments a child component that receives the subscribed data as a prop. Let’s call the function `withSubscription`:

我们可以编写一个用于创建类似 `CommentList` 和 `BlogPost` 这种订阅了 `DataSource` 的组件的函数。这个函数其中一个参数用于接收一个子组件，该子组件通过 props 来获取订阅的数据。这里我们把这个函数命名为 `withSubscription`:

```js
const CommentListWithSubscription = withSubscription(
  CommentList,
  (DataSource) => DataSource.getComments()
);

const BlogPostWithSubscription = withSubscription(
  BlogPost,
  (DataSource, props) => DataSource.getBlogPost(props.id)
);
```

The first parameter is the wrapped component. The second parameter retrieves the data we’re interested in, given a `DataSource` and the current props.

第一个参数就是包装的组件。在给定 DataSource 和当前 props 的情况下，第二个参数用于检索我们感兴趣的数据。

When `CommentListWithSubscription` and `BlogPostWithSubscription` are rendered, `CommentList` and `BlogPost` will be passed a `data` prop with the most current data retrieved from `DataSource`:

当 `CommentListWithSubscription` 和 `BlogPostWithSubscription` 被渲染的时候，它们会把从 `DataSource` 那里获取的数据通过 props 传递给 `CommentList` 和 `BlogPost`。

```js
// This function takes a component...
function withSubscription(WrappedComponent, selectData) {
  // ...and returns another component...
  return class extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
      this.state = {
        data: selectData(DataSource, props)
      };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      // ... that takes care of the subscription...
      DataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      DataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);
    }

    handleChange() {
      this.setState({
        data: selectData(DataSource, this.props)
      });
    }

    render() {
      // ... and renders the wrapped component with the fresh data!
      // Notice that we pass through any additional props
      return <WrappedComponent data={this.state.data} {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
```

Note that a HOC doesn’t modify the input component, nor does it use inheritance to copy its behavior. Rather, a HOC composes the original component by wrapping it in a container component. A HOC is a pure function with zero side-effects.

注意高阶组件不会修改 input 组件，也不会使用继承来拷贝它们的行为。 相反，高阶组件通过把原来的组件封装在一个容器组件中来包含它。高阶组件应该是一个零副作用的纯函数。

And that’s it! The wrapped component receives all the props of the container, along with a new prop, `data`, which it uses to render its output. The HOC isn’t concerned with how or why the data is used, and the wrapped component isn’t concerned with where the data came from.

Because `withSubscription` is a normal function, you can add as many or as few arguments as you like. For example, you may want to make the name of the `data` prop configurable, to further isolate the HOC from the wrapped component. Or you could accept an argument that configures `shouldComponentUpdate`, or one that configures the data source. These are all possible because the HOC has full control over how the component is defined.

Like components, the contract between `withSubscription` and the wrapped component is entirely props-based. This makes it easy to swap one HOC for a different one, as long as they provide the same props to the wrapped component. This may be useful if you change data-fetching libraries, for example.

## Don’t Mutate the Original Component. Use Composition.

Resist the temptation to modify a component’s prototype (or otherwise mutate it) inside a HOC.

```js
function logProps(InputComponent) {
  InputComponent.prototype.componentWillReceiveProps = function(nextProps) {
    console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
    console.log('Next props: ', nextProps);
  };
  // The fact that we're returning the original input is a hint that it has
  // been mutated.
  return InputComponent;
}

// EnhancedComponent will log whenever props are received
const EnhancedComponent = logProps(InputComponent);
```

There are a few problems with this. One is that the input component cannot be reused separately from the enhanced component. More crucially, if you apply another HOC to `EnhancedComponent` that also mutates `componentWillReceiveProps`, the first HOC’s functionality will be overridden! This HOC also won’t work with function components, which do not have lifecycle methods.

Mutating HOCs are a leaky abstraction—the consumer must know how they are implemented in order to avoid conflicts with other HOCs.

Instead of mutation, HOCs should use composition, by wrapping the input component in a container component:

```js
function logProps(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
      console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
      console.log('Next props: ', nextProps);
    }
    render() {
      // Wraps the input component in a container, without mutating it. Good!
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  }
}
```

This HOC has the same functionality as the mutating version while avoiding the potential for clashes. It works equally well with class and function components. And because it’s a pure function, it’s composable with other HOCs, or even with itself.

You may have noticed similarities between HOCs and a pattern called **container components**. Container components are part of a strategy of separating responsibility between high-level and low-level concerns. Containers manage things like subscriptions and state, and pass props to components that handle things like rendering UI. HOCs use containers as part of their implementation. You can think of HOCs as parameterized container component definitions.

## Convention: Pass Unrelated Props Through to the Wrapped Component

HOCs add features to a component. They shouldn’t drastically alter its contract. It’s expected that the component returned from a HOC has a similar interface to the wrapped component.

HOCs should pass through props that are unrelated to its specific concern. Most HOCs contain a render method that looks something like this:

```js
render() {
  // Filter out extra props that are specific to this HOC and shouldn't be
  // passed through
  const { extraProp, ...passThroughProps } = this.props;

  // Inject props into the wrapped component. These are usually state values or
  // instance methods.
  const injectedProp = someStateOrInstanceMethod;

  // Pass props to wrapped component
  return (
    <WrappedComponent
      injectedProp={injectedProp}
      {...passThroughProps}
    />
  );
}
```

This convention helps ensure that HOCs are as flexible and reusable as possible.

## Convention: Maximizing Composability


Not all HOCs look the same. Sometimes they accept only a single argument, the wrapped component:

```js
const NavbarWithRouter = withRouter(Navbar);
```

Usually, HOCs accept additional arguments. In this example from Relay, a config object is used to specify a component’s data dependencies:

```js
const CommentWithRelay = Relay.createContainer(Comment, config);
```

The most common signature for HOCs looks like this:

```js
// React Redux's `connect`
const ConnectedComment = connect(commentSelector, commentActions)(CommentList);
```

What?! If you break it apart, it’s easier to see what’s going on.

```js
// connect is a function that returns another function
const enhance = connect(commentListSelector, commentListActions);
// The returned function is a HOC, which returns a component that is connected
// to the Redux store
const ConnectedComment = enhance(CommentList);
```

In other words, `connect` is a higher-order function that returns a higher-order component!

This form may seem confusing or unnecessary, but it has a useful property. Single-argument HOCs like the one returned by the `connect` function have the signature `Component => Component`. Functions whose output type is the same as its input type are really easy to compose together.

```js
// Instead of doing this...
const EnhancedComponent = withRouter(connect(commentSelector)(WrappedComponent))

// ... you can use a function composition utility
// compose(f, g, h) is the same as (...args) => f(g(h(...args)))
const enhance = compose(
  // These are both single-argument HOCs
  withRouter,
  connect(commentSelector)
)
const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent)
```

(This same property also allows `connect` and other enhancer-style HOCs to be used as decorators, an experimental JavaScript proposal.)

The `compose` utility function is provided by many third-party libraries including lodash (as [lodash.flowRight](https://lodash.com/docs/#flowRight)), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/compose.html), and [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#compose).

## Convention: Wrap the Display Name for Easy Debugging

The container components created by HOCs show up in the [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) like any other component. To ease debugging, choose a display name that communicates that it’s the result of a HOC.

The most common technique is to wrap the display name of the wrapped component. So if your higher-order component is named `withSubscription`, and the wrapped component’s display name is `CommentList`, use the display name `WithSubscription(CommentList)`:

```js
function withSubscription(WrappedComponent) {
  class WithSubscription extends React.Component {
      /* ... */
  }
  WithSubscription.displayName = `WithSubscription(${getDisplayName(WrappedComponent)})`;
  return WithSubscription;
}

function getDisplayName(WrappedComponent) {
  return WrappedComponent.displayName || WrappedComponent.name || 'Component';
}
```

## Caveats （注意事项）

Higher-order components come with a few caveats that aren’t immediately obvious if you’re new to React.

### Don’t Use HOCs Inside the render Method

React’s diffing algorithm (called reconciliation) uses component identity to determine whether it should update the existing subtree or throw it away and mount a new one. If the component returned from `render` is identical (`===`) to the component from the previous render, React recursively updates the subtree by diffing it with the new one. If they’re not equal, the previous subtree is unmounted completely.

Normally, you shouldn’t need to think about this. But it matters for HOCs because it means you can’t apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component:

```js
render() {
  // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render
  // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2
  const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);
  // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
  return <EnhancedComponent />;
}
```

The problem here isn’t just about performance — remounting a component causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost.

Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once. Then, its identity will be consistent across renders. This is usually what you want, anyway.

In those rare cases where you need to apply a HOC dynamically, you can also do it inside a component’s lifecycle methods or its constructor.

### Static Methods Must Be Copied Over

Sometimes it’s useful to define a static method on a React component. For example, Relay containers expose a static method `getFragment` to facilitate the composition of GraphQL fragments.

When you apply a HOC to a component, though, the original component is wrapped with a container component. That means the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component.

```js
// Define a static method
WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function() {/*...*/}
// Now apply a HOC
const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);

// The enhanced component has no static method
typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === 'undefined' // true
```

To solve this, you could copy the methods onto the container before returning it:

```js
function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
  class Enhance extends React.Component {/*...*/}
  // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(
  Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;
  return Enhance;
}
```

However, this requires you to know exactly which methods need to be copied. You can use [hoist-non-react-statics](https://github.com/mridgway/hoist-non-react-statics) to automatically copy all non-React static methods:

```js
import hoistNonReactStatic from 'hoist-non-react-statics';
function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
  class Enhance extends React.Component {/*...*/}
  hoistNonReactStatic(Enhance, WrappedComponent);
  return Enhance;
}
```

Another possible solution is to export the static method separately from the component itself.

```js
// Instead of...
MyComponent.someFunction = someFunction;
export default MyComponent;

// ...export the method separately...
export { someFunction };

// ...and in the consuming module, import both
import MyComponent, { someFunction } from './MyComponent.js';
```

### Refs Aren’t Passed Through

While the convention for higher-order components is to pass through all props to the wrapped component, this does not work for refs. That’s because `ref` is not really a prop — like `key`, it’s handled specially by React. If you add a ref to an element whose component is the result of a HOC, the ref refers to an instance of the outermost container component, not the wrapped component.

The solution for this problem is to use the `React.forwardRef` API (introduced with React 16.3). [Learn more about it in the forwarding refs section](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html).
